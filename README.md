# _Website Features_

# _Continuous Elements_

These features are across all of the pages, giving a basic structure which gives the user a more pleasent experience and they are able to easly navigate throught out the website.

## _1 - The background_

The background for index.html and the gallery.html is a slightly yellow-creamy color `#f5e5001c` this is so the focus can be on the content and for the user to be able to read the content or look at the images with ease

There is an image for the background for the events.html and contact.html 

The image is used on these to pages because there are larger gaps between the content, so with the picture it takes away  these areas of block colour and give the user an more exciteble experince.
